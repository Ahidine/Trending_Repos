This project was created for  gemography /frontend-coding-challenge 

## Idea 
The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below).

## Why ReactJs
this project was created by the framewrok ReactJs, I chose this last one because I've already worked with Angular and VueJs and I just finished a self-training on React and I wanted to prove what I learned. 

## Libraries 
- axios : Axios is a Javascript library used to make http requests
        It can be used intercept http requests and responses.
        It automatically transform request and response data.
        It enables client-side protection against XSRF.
- Reactstrap  : to use React Bootstrap 4 components for design 
- bootstrap 4 : framework for css  , reactstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this - - - needs to be installed as well
- react-infinite-scroll-component : A component to make all your infinite scrolling
- momentJs : to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.
